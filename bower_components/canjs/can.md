This is the detailed documentation of the API for CanJS, a framework for building
web applications that provides a lightweight inheritance system, observable
objects and values, and a powerful MVC core with live-bound templates, among other
resources. You can use it out of the box on top of jQuery, Zepto, YUI, and Mootools,
and it's only 13K.

If you are just starting with CanJS, you may want to try our [getting started guide](../guides/Tutorial.html).
